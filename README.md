This project builds a Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering based on Matrix Factorization. The core concept is learning latent feature representations for both users and movies from historical rating data rather than relying on content information. A user–item interaction matrix is constructed from the dataset, and mean normalization is applied to reduce rating bias. The model uses embedding layers to represent users and movies as dense vectors in a shared latent space, and predicted ratings are computed using the dot product of these embeddings along with user and movie bias terms. The system is trained using supervised learning by minimizing Mean Squared Error (MSE) with the Adam optimizer. Key concepts involved include sparse matrix handling, gradient-based optimization, vectorized computations, and regularization considerations to prevent overfitting. This implementation demonstrates how latent factor models can capture hidden patterns in user preferences to generate personalized recommendations.
